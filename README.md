## Requirements
This type of system will work in ROS version.

## Installation and configuration
There is there process on how I install hamdan_topics. First, to create a packege I used ( catkin_create_pkg hamdan_topics \rospy std_msgs message_runtime message_generation). second I touch it by using (touch hamdan_topics/src/topic_publisher.py).After creating the new packege I have to make it executable by using chmod u+x hamdan_topics/src/topics_publisher.py. Then, I wrote the codes and using catkin_make to make it the package available. Then, I source it using source devel/setup.bash. After all that, we run it by using rosrun my_topics topic_publisher.py.
